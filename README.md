# Time-Series

This repository contains notes and programming applications on time series modeling. Time series analysis assumes special importance in the field of Financial and Econometric Analyes and it is for this reason that we have compiled notes that lay out the mathematics and theories underpinning the associated concepts.

The document called **Time_Series_NS** is primarily meant to guide you through the rigorous mathematical concepts.
